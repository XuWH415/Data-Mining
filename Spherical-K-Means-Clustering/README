HW4 from Wenhao Xu:

To test Homework 4, use command:
	python cluster.py

Four python files are used to perform the main task in this homework. Those files are:
	cluster.py # Main file
	sphericalKMeans.py # Includes class SphericalKMeans
	nbc.py # Modified file from HW3
	statistics.py # Additional file to make up the difference between python 2.* and python 3.*

Also, to test the hypothesis, there is another file that runs the T-test:
	hypothesis_test.py

There is a R script to plot the learning curve with error bar:
	plot.R

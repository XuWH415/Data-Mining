	There is a issue about function scipy.stats.chisquare(f_obs,  f_exp=None, ddof=0, axis=0).
	
	I have the newer version of scipy, v0.15, which for this function it have a new argument 'axis'. 
	In the server data.cs.purdue.edu, it has a older version of scipy, v0.12, which does not have this
	argument and will show an error when I use that argument. If you have the same issue, please
	let me know.

Homework 5:
	To run this program, use command:
		python apriori.py
	
	To get top 30 rules for each situation, you need to uncomment a few line in the codes to let the printRule() function work.
